idk how to start blog posts im just gonna start yapping
<br>
so recently i've been kind of easing myself into the touhou project series
<br>
i kind of don't have time to go on a full obsession with touhou right now because of school and all that
<br>
but i still very much enjoy touhou
<br>
<br>
one of the main things i like about touhou is 100% the music
<br>
dunno what ZUN is doing but he cooks so hard the kitchen bursts into flames bro
<br>
if anyone has snooped around... you can see that most of my scrobbles for the past 2 weeks or so have just been touhou tracks.
<br>
i really like the touhou 6 soundtrack because it's just the most recognizable for me and still a banger, but i do like the other games' soundtracks too. there's a few tracks in particular that are my favorite:
<br>
- メイドと血の懐中時計 (TH6)
- 月時計　～ ルナ・ダイアル (TH6)
- U.N.オーエンは彼女なのか？ (TH6) (of course...)
- 夜雀の歌声　～ Night Bird (TH8)
- 懐かしき東方の血　～ Old World (TH8)
- 永夜の報い　～ Imperishable Night. (TH8)
- 竹取飛翔　～ Lunatic Princess (TH8)
- フラワリングナイト (TH9) (of course...)
- 六十年目の東方裁判　～ Fate of Sixty Years (TH9)
- ハートフェルトファンシー (TH11)
- 少女さとり　～ 3rd eye (TH11)
- 青空の影 (TH12)

<br>
this likely won't be all, since i haven't really extensively listened to the soundtracks after TH11. and uh... sorry about the track names not being translated. i copied them off spotify. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
<br>

## i suck at shmups
that being said, i may have listened to the soundtrack a lot, but the only game in the series i've actually played so far is touhou 6. first off, like i've already said, i kind of don't have time right now to play games... writing this blog post is a form of procrastination too. but also, i didn't know how bad i was at shoot em' ups (shmups) until i started playing touhou 6. like, i'm REALLY bad at them. i managed to complete the 5 stages on easy mode after a number of tries i haven't been counting, but since you're locked out of stage 6 on that difficulty, i was kinda mad when i got the bad ending and it told me to complete the game on normal difficulty or higher without using any continues. it took me at least a dozen replays to be able to even reach stage 5 on normal mode... and of course i died to sakuya. i haven't played since then, but i definitely want to try again and get that 1 credit clear on normal mode at least (1cc, a clear with no continues).
<br>
### shmup controls???
i also want to talk about the controls of shmups... i personally don't like the arrow keys. yell at me all you want about sucking it up and just using the default controls but i really can't use arrow keys for movement. i'm way too used to the usual WASD layout. so, i ended up downloading AutoHotKey to remap my controls since TH6 doesn't give that option natively (speaking of which, i downloaded it using THcrap, so i added a few other patches too, like the retexture patch and visible hitbox patch). actually, i originally downloaded AHK for undertale since it also uses arrow key controls. anyways, i also remapped some other buttons like the bomb key (x), shoot key (z), and focus key (left shift) to h, j, k respectively. again, please do not stare at my control layout in disgust behind the screen thanks... i ordered it this way so my left hand can control movement, and my right hand can control shooting, bombing, and precise movement toggling. i think so far this has worked out for me better, as i can use pre-existing hand coordination skills to play the game less... shittily. 
<br>
### oh god mouse controls
actually, at some point i got so frustrated with using the keyboard that i searched online for mouse control options, since that would allow far more precision with movement and just let you dodge the bullets like the matrix (this could probably be considered cheating lol). well, i did find one, and after a bit of troubleshooting, i got it to work. i believe it's on github as [THMouseX](https://github.com/Meigyoku-Thmn/ThMouseX), so if you want mouse controls for whatever reason, you can use that for pretty much all of the touhou games. now there were still some issues that couldn't be solved because of some limitations, all of which are described on the github repository, like the game character lagging behind the mouse whenever you make fast mouse movements across the screen. this is due to the game character only being able to move at a set speed of like... 5 pixels per frame i think? so it can't "teleport" across the screen with the mouse cursor. this also caused another issue of the game character sprite swaying left and right crazily, since you can make pixel precise movements with the mouse, but the game character is forced to move 5 pixels per frame. i got to stage 4 on normal difficulty with it, so i don't think mouse controls were too bad, but i didn't really feel like it was any better than just using the keyboard, especially when i'd already played so many times with the keyboard specifically to get used to it. it also isn't very conventional, since literally everyone else in the community is playing touhou the intended way (do they even know that THMouseX exists?). i felt that i should probably just play with keyboard controls, even if they aren't in the default setup of arrow key movements, and that it'd be better in the long run when playing through the rest of the list of games in the touhou series anyway. basically, i suck balls at shmups. so much so that even when i used cheat-y controls, i still couldn't get past stage 4...
<br>
### what the hell is a focus
also, when i first started playing, i had no clue what the controls were... so i kind of had to figure out that the z key was for confirm and for shooting, the x key was for bombing, etc... which also led to me not knowing that left shift was the focus key that allowed for slower movement and thus more precise input... so i ended up playing quite a few rounds just moving like a maniac around bullets, or pressing my movement keys unnecessarily loudly because i had to tap the key for like, half a second, just to move a few less pixels to the right and not overshoot and throw myself into a bullet. this is what people usually mean by practicing "micro-movements"... tapping your movement key repeatedly in very short increments to move smaller, precise distances across the screen... but thats a little more difficult when you're moving at max speed constantly and trying to move just a few pixels. well! learning about focusing was definitely very helpful. made micro-movements much less painful to do and made my movements more precise in general, since i didn't have to worry about overshooting any movement inputs when trying to fit through tiny gaps between the bullets. focusing also made reimu B and marisa B much more viable options for me. i knew that you could streamline your bullets with them and it would generally deal more dps to bosses than their A versions, but i didn't know how to do that... imagine playing as those WITHOUT focusing...

## ok but TOUHOU touhou.
enough about the controls, maybe i should talk about the actual content in the touhou series... if i actually knew anything at all. i'm one of the people who got into the game through the music, so i know basically nothing about the actual series and its characters, story, lore, and whatnot. my first exposure to touhou was literally bad apple, and maybe that one [JzBoy animation of undertale frisk vs sakuya inaoya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTKCtyD8kBY) when i was a wee little kid. awesome stuff though btw. i was only more interested in getting into touhou *now* because of my recent discovery of the touhou soundtrack on spotify, which i've just been listening to non-stop for a while. but regardless, my knowledge of the touhou series is currently VERY limited, and i've watched like maybe 5 videos from [GensouChronicle](https://www.youtube.com/@GensouChronicle), giving me a little more insight into how the world of touhou works. so far, all i really know is that touhou takes place in gensokyo, that it's blocked of from modern society by the great hakurei barrier because the youkai can only survive within the barrier since they've been largely forgotten by modern society. there's a village of humans in gensokyo that are solely there to keep the youkai in existence. the individual characters themselves, i don't know much about. i know reimu is a shrine maiden, marisa is a magician, and cirno is an ice fairy. that's literally it. yeah, i know. what an "extensive wealth" of knowledge about the characters, one of the main focal points of the touhou series, lol. but, i was really just hoping that i could gain information about the characters through the games, so i'll be holding off on any content outside that (manga, maybe the "unofficial official" anime...) for after i've cleared or at least tried the games. hopefully, i'll get better at shmups too...

i think that's about it on touhou that i have right now off the top of my head. back to homework now...
