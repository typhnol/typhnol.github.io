hi guys if it wasn't obvious enough i super duper duper super like ultrakill 
<br>
## the gameplay
### the combat
i love ultrakill combat its so awesome and cool
<br>
you have 5 weapon types each with 3 variations (blue, green, red), and some weapon types have their own alternative version. its awesome how much is actually in your arsenal. and you can do crazy shit with it. the marksman revolver is literally the coolest thing ever made. you can throw a coin and shoot it normally to redirect (ricoshot) the bullet to the nearest enemy's weak point. BUUUTTT...! you can shoot the coin with OTHER WEAPONS! shoot it with the piercer revolver charged shot! shoot it with the railcannon! PUNCH the COIN! and shoot it! it all adds to your damage! and you'll look stylish as hell. heh. as hell. and parrying shit is so satisfying in this game bro... you can parry ANYTHING. finding out you can parry king minos's punches was crazy. also projectile boosting. did you know you can parry your own shotgun pellets? wow! i definitely do not overuse that attack! switching between guns is also fun and well, kinda necessary for gameplay since there's a "freshness" meter that multiplies your damage. stay on one weapon for too long and it'll grow dull. anyways playing this game is so fun. it's like a shot of adrenaline. i drank multiple cans of coca cola once while playing this game and i learned that sugar rushes and adrenaline do not mix well. please do not do that.
<br>
### the movement
OH BOY! MACH 20!
<br>
bro holy moly you can ride the rockets
<br>
oh yeah and the rest of the movement. it tastes like the [[FREEDOM]] motif. you can literally launch yourself left right up diagonal all with a little silly thing called slam storage. movement tech is insane in this game. also slide hopping/dash hopping is so fun... yall know that section in 2-4 before the king minos fight... you can just hop your way through the train tracks. it's fun.
<br>
### the system
EVERYTHING YOU DO is recorded on the style meter. literally ANYTHING you do. anyways i find it hilarious that the style bonus for punching an enemy is +DISRESPECT. killing enemies in certain ways can also give you specific style bonuses. +EXPLODED, +BLUNT FORCE, +NAILBOMBED, +FRIED, +AIRSHOT, +CATAPULTED, +CANNONBALLED, +BOILED, +MAURICED, +MINCED, +ROADKILL, + OSHA VIOLATION, +SCRINDONGULODED????? wow!
<br>
## the story
the lore is pretty awesome too! the game is inspired by dante's nine circles of hell, so the layers in the game kinda follow that. we got king minos and his sad backstory in the lust layer... we got sisyphus and his backstory in the greed layer... we also have the archangel gabriel who has been a reoccuring antagonist to v1 (who is a killing machine we play as) discovering defeat for the first time! or multiple times. i know you people beat him up every once in a while for fun. anyways... something something humanity never ended the first world war and actually decided to go to war for decades, leading to the arms race and a bunch of the machines we see in the game... v1 was made to be at the top of the evolution ladder to counter the earthmovers but the war ended before they could use it. and then humanity discovered hell but it was too dangerous so they sealed it away and then eventually all went extinct. then the machines left behind rediscovered hell and killed all the inhabitants of the layers because they needed blood to survive, being that they're all war machines. uhhh uhhh this is a really gross over simplification but if you're interested at all i'd highly recommend reading up on it on your own or something. maybe a video essay. but it's super interesting. all the weapons and enemies and layers in the game have their own place in the lore. theres a bunch of stuff that have lore explanations.
<br>
## the MUSIC
ok real talk here I FUCKING LOVE THE ULTRAKILL SOUNDTRACK
<br>
look i usually wouldn't listen to breakcore (or whatever genre of that ULTRAKILL is) but this game single handedly got me into it. if it's not ultrakill, then it's some of hakita's other works. i gained a taste for post-rock noise music now because of this guy. he has a bunch of other albums and even on other usernames that i listen to. there's the usual HEAVEN PIERCE HER which is ultrakill stuff, and also garden of romance (i LOVE garden of romance its a REALLY long piece but the progression is worth it), there's just regular HAKITA where he posts his original stuff, like recently he posted tennis, everyone? and i've been listening to that one a lot. he also has another name that used to be called redherring. but recently changed to Piranesi. and is now actively posting stuff! hakita is so awesome man. so cool. thanks for making ULTRAKILL dawg.

<br>
anyways i love ultrakill keep slaying and stay hydrated on blood fellow killing machines goodbye
